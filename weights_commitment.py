"""
The round's weights commitment: exactly what we pin on chain before the draw.

Before the draw the program receives `weights_hash`, a fingerprint of who put
how much behind which coin. After the draw anyone should be able to rebuild the
same list, compute the same hash, and satisfy themselves that the shares were
computed from those numbers and not from adjusted ones.

So the rule for building it lives here, in one place, and both users share it:
the phase worker that puts the hash into the program, and the round verification
page that hands out the preimage. They cannot drift apart by construction — and
if they lived separately they would have drifted on the first day.

There are two rules, because there have been two.

**Rule 2, used by every round from 2026-09-24 on.** Amounts are whole lamports,
which is what the chain counts and what the draw actually weighs by.

1. Take the round's active commits and sum them per coin, in lamports.
2. Drop anything that sums to zero.
3. Sort by descending amount, and by coin address when equal.
4. Write it as a JSON array of pairs `[["<mint>",<lamports>],…]`.
5. sha256 of that string in UTF-8.

**Rule 1, used by every round before that**, and kept so those rounds still
verify. Identical except that amounts were in SOL, rounded to eight decimals.

Eight decimals of SOL is ten lamports, and that is the whole reason rule 2
exists: the draw weighs by raw lamports while the commitment pinned a rounded
figure, so the numbers we published were not quite the numbers the draw used.
The gap is reachable on purpose — a commit is checked against the chain in
lamports, so anyone can deposit 50_000_001 and make the two disagree. Measured
over four thousand values, the rounding disagreed with the draw on 3604 of
them; going through lamports disagreed on none.

It never changed an outcome that anyone could notice — a few lamports move the
sampler's boundaries by a few parts in ten billion — but "verify it yourself"
has to mean the published numbers are the numbers, so it is fixed rather than
explained away.
